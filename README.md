# FÃªte (Party in French)

A simple NES emulator written in Rust. The GUI is written with `winit` for a windowing system and `softbuffer` is used for rendering. Audio is handled by `rodio`.

## Why?

Why not? Emulation seems like an interesting thing to do ðŸ¤·. I also needed some experience with unit testing among other things.
